# Contributing to this Repo
## What should I work on?
- Take a look at our open issues, if you are new to this project, look for the ones with the
`Good First Issue` tag.
- Take a look at our projects, if you think there is something you would like
to work on that contributes to the project, then feel free to work on it and make a PR!
- You can always reach out to me ([hello@czhang.me](mailto:hello@czhang.me)) or any of the
contributors, we can talk about what our next steps are.

## Development Process
1. If you have something you would like to work on, or you found a bug, please open an issue
if there isn't one already. If the issue is related to a certain project, please
tag the project in the issue.
1. If you would like to "own" a certain open issue, assign yourself to it.
1. Do your work on a feature branch (preferably on your own fork), once you are done,
make a PR! Draft PRs are always welcome so that any of the contributors can give you early
feedback.
1. Make sure to add appropriate tests for any of the code you write, the reviewers will also
remind you if you forget.
1. Make sure to mention any of the issues that this PR will close. For example,
including "this closes #24" or "this fixes #24" in the PR description
means that issue #24 will be closed once this PR is merged.
1. If this PR is not related to any issues but is related to a project, please
tag the appropriate project in the PR.
1. Once someone has approved your PR and your code passes the tests on CircleCI, then feel
free to merge it.
1. **Reviewers: once you approved a PR, please don't merge it and let the author merge it
themselves.**
1. Rince and repeat :)
