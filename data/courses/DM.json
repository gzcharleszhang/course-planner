Microstructure insensitive properties such as density, modulus and coefficient of linear expansion which are unaffected by processing.\r\n* Properties such as strength, fracture toughness, fatigue and creep that are affected by processing and the resultant microstructure. How processing influences these properties including corrosion resistance, and the manner in which they change during the fabrication of components.\r\n* Processing of metals and alloys. Solid state equilibrium and non-equilibrium transformations. Melting, solidification and casting of metals, including welding. Plastic deformation including rolling and annealing. Thermal processes such as surface treatments.\r\n* Processing of non-metals. Extrusion, injection molding, thermoforming of thermoplastic polymers. Fabrication of thermosets. Solidification of glasses. Superplastic forming and forming of glasses. Preparation and fabrication of \r\ncomposite materials.\r\n* Design and selection of materials. Performance and selection of ferrous materials for engineering design, considering low alloy steels, tool steels, stainless steels and cast irons.\r\n* Performance and selection of non-ferrous materials for engineering performance considering aluminum, magnesium, copper and nickel alloys.\r\n* Performance and selection of polymers, ceramics and composites for engineering performance.",

The fundamental ideas underlying the perspective are: (1) that a firm\u0012s technology strategy emerges from its technological competencies and capabilities, (2) that the technology strategy is shaped by evolutionary external (environmental) and internal (organizational) Forces. The course draws on strategic management, economics and organization theory for analytical tools to address important challenges faced by senior and middle managers in technology based firms. The course is practice oriented. Case studies of various real life situations will require in-depth analysis to be complemented with specific action recommendations.\r\n* To develop an awareness of the range, scope and complexity of the issues and problems related to strategic management of technology and innovation\r\n* To develop an understanding of the state of the art of strategic management of technology and innovation\r\n* To learn how to practically apply theoretical concepts in strategic management of\r\n technology and innovation.",

An applied approach is used in this study.  The course begins with a general overview of quality, including the various ways of defining and measuring quality and the Cost-of-quality model. This culminates in an introduction to total quality (TOM) and its three conrnerstones: continuous improvement, customer focus, and total organizational involvement.  The remainder of the course examines these cornerstones in greater detail.  The objectives of the course are: (1) to develop an appreciation for importance of managing the quality at all levels, and stages of the organization, (2) to introduce techniques for defining, monitoring, and improving quality, and (3) to encourage critical thinking about issues in managing quality, within the organization, and in society in general.",
