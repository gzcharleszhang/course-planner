Futuristic film architecture will provide an opportunity to study a vision of the future of urban built form and provide a forum for critical discussion.

The main focus is the nature of the institution and its relationship to the city and its culture. Students participating in the Rome term are expected to defray the costs of travel, accommodation and food. For students unable to study in Rome, an alternative studio is offered in Cambridge. It presents similar design projects and theoretical questions in a North American context. [Offered: F]",

Students will investigate how design projects improve the quality of life of mid-size cities (i.e. creative city concept).  Together, we will focus on identifying opportunities for innovative collaborations and tangible improvements to the design of urban environments.  The school is especially interested in strengthening collaboration among universities, community residents, planning and design practitioners, and policymkaers to seize their own destiny to design, model, and plan.  Accordingly, we will investigate thematic (e.g. urban revitalization, design/aesthetics, environmental/greening, gentrification, housing, and multiculturalism) and policy-oriented areas (e.g. urban design guidelines, new urbanism, intensification, and land-use development patterns) that relate to the mid-size city.

Forms of partnerships, rules of professional conduct, the constituents of an enforceable contract, professional liability, client-architect relations and the typical challenges encountered in practice are among the essential elements to be studies. Factors affecting both the cost of construction and the ability of an architect to conduct a viable business will be presented.

What is taught facilitates an integrated design process where all disciplines collaborate through all phases of a project to achieve a sustainable design. There will be an exploration of software applications including the generation of landscapes and vegetation, energy analysis, acoustics, lighting, structure, people movement, air flow analysis, microclimate analysis and various types of three-dimensional modelling software, particularly, packages that facilitate interfacing with rapid prototyping and allow complex form generation. Rapid prototyping techniques will include laser cutting, three-dimensional printing and CNC 3-axis machining. The course format is a seminar in which each student will explore some of these technologies in depth by means of a small design example and presentations to the class while obtaining an overview from the course lectures and presentations by other students on other applications.",

The rigorous consideration of precedent and design research methods fosters a deeper connection of students' work with the discipline, better enabling them to position their ideas within a larger conceptual discourse while giving them the methodological tools to prepare them for the undertaking of a research and design thesis.",

The course is intended to provide students with an advanced knowledge base in contemporary architectural theory to ground more specialized graduate elective coursework while acting as a support for thesis and other forms of advanced architectural research.",
