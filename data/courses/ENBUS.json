After learning relevant research methods, student teams develop a proposal on a research project which meets the needs of their assigned live case study (i.e. the company or other organization which has committed to be the case in the research project).  This proposal includes a review of the relevant literature, the methodology,, the timeline, and a breakdown of task assignments.   Next students obtain ethics approval for their research project.  Then student teams apply the business sustainability toolbox, and their management skills to the real-world problem of their live case.  Each field study includes conducting a situation analysis, developing a sustainability strategic plan for the organization including a complete and coherent business case.  A Faculty member assists each team.  Students deliver field study project results as a report to both the organization and the course instructor.  Individual students also complete a reflection paper including a discussion of the case in relation to the application of the tools, frameworks and literature.",
