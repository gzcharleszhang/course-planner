Various perspectives of the concepts of health and illness will be introduced. Emphasis is on understanding the origins, factors and conditions that determine health throughout the lifespan, how these factors influence one another and the role/impact of health care. Additional topics include how health is measured, the leading causes of death, illness and disability, as well as how health status has changed throughout history. Students will also learn how to research and critically analyze the health literature and discuss important health issues with their peers.",

Provisions must be approved by the community agency and the course coordinator. Placements are normally 8 to 10 hours per week for 8 weeks. In the final week of the term students will meet to reflect upon and share their experience with fellow students. Students will also complete a written report detailing whether and how they achieved their objectives, what they learned from the process relevant to the practice of health promotion, and how their experience utilized or exemplified course based material and assignments.
