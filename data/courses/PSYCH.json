The course follows a model testing approach in which parameters for full and restricted models are predicted, and the adequacy of the models compared. Concepts such as power, effect size, error rates, contrasts, trend analyses, nonorthogonality, and so forth are discussed for higher-order, between and within -subjects designs. Special attention is given to analyses with multiple dependent variables (MANOVA). Finally, the application of randomization tests is presented as an alternative to theoretical distributions of test statistics, and the relationships of ANOVA and multiple regression techniques are also examined for simple and complex designs.",

The ability to reason about beliefs, desires, and other mental states is often called \"theory of mind.\"  How this ability develops in childhood, has been greatly debated over the past 20 years, and remains mysterious (e.g. how can we learn that people have mental states when we cannot see mental states, but only infer them by observing people's behaviour).  This course will mainly concern the development of theory of mind in childhood, and we will discuss the major empirical discoveries and theoretical positions in this area of investigation.",

For example, children can pretend that a banana is a telephone, that their juice is in an empty cup, or that a clean teddybear is dirty.  Although pretence is often taken for granted, and perhaps considered childish, it is mysterious: How do children pretend, and purposely represent the world as different than it really is?  And how are children able to recognize what others pretend?  Are children behaviourists about pretend play? Or does successful pretence signal that your children engage in mental state reasoning ('theory of mind')?  Theories of children's (and adults') pretence have sought to provide answers to the questions.  These theories are still actively debated, and are the main topic of this course.  Relevant experimental work will also be discussed.",

Students will learn the principles behind the EEG/ERP recordings and analyses, how to design EEG studies in normal and abnormal populations and across the life-time and how to analyze and interpret EEG and ERP data, including source localization.  The course is composed of a theoretical part and a practial hands-on lab component in which students will see how to test and record human subjects in EEG and how to analyze their recordings using specific software.  Students willing to incorporate EEG as part of their research are strongly encouraged to attend this course.",

Multiple aspects of the face such as its identity, age, race, gender, emotion or gaze direction need to be extracted and processed rapidly and accurately by the brain to allow efficient social interactions.  This seminar offers a multidisciplinary approach to the study of face perception.  We will cover major aspects of face processing including the perception and recognition of identity, emotions and gaze direction, their neural bases and their links to social cognition and theory of mind.  We will discuss chapters and fundamental papers integrating the most recent findings from neuropsychology, neuroimaging and cognitive psychology.  This course is most suited for students interested in brain-behaviour relationships.  Basic Cognitive Neuroscience knowledge is required.",

Accordingly, topics examined will be self-regulation, negotiation, ethics, and citizenship behavior. By necessity, coverage of these topics will not be comprehensive; the primary goal of the course is to simply introduce students to a broad range of theories and topics that are relevant to organizational psychology.",

The practicum component will involve a commitment of up to 30 hours during the formal lecture period. Students wishing to enter the course must obtain a police check prior to the second week of classes. Transportation to the apprenticeship/volunteer setting is the student's responsibility.

We will also examine major theories of goal structure and the dynamics of goal pursuit.

Researchers able to effectively use this diverse toolkit are better positioned to solve important problems in cognitive psychology.  The goal of this course is to provide students with novel experiences conducting research in cognitive psychology.  To this end, contingent on the availability of appropriate opportunities, students will work in a laboratory outside that of their primary research advisor on an independent research project relevant to cognitive psychology.  Through this course, students will gain experience applying new methods and approaches in cognitive psychology, learn new research skills, and expand their professional networks.",
