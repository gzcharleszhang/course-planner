Theoretical and empirical exploration of core operations concepts such as supply chain management, process configuration, quality and process improvement, and lean systems will be undertaken. Once a strong foundational understanding of these core concepts is achieved, students will then explore the opportunities and threats posed by emergent social and environmental issues to organizations, and how those issues can be integrated into the strategy underlying operations and process management. Concepts such as eco-efficiency, sustainable supply chain management, environmental management systems (e.g., ISO 14000), and life cycle assessment will be explored.",
